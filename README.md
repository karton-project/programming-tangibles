# programming-tangibles

Series of experiments to explore affordable ways of programming with tangibles.

## Code Notes

Code Notes Project aims to explore paper cards in various programming environments.

1. **CodeNotes-Legacy** is our first experiment to explore paper cards to teach simple structures such as for loops, if/else statements.
2. **CodeNotes-Story** explores creating stories with paper cards and blockly-based drag and drop blocks.
3. **CodeNotes-Drawing** is an experiment to create Processing like environment to draw with paper-based programming blocks.
